# PulseCast

Forecasting, recommendations, scheduling optimization, behavioural analytics and SQL.

## Run

Python 3.10+ is required. From this folder:

```console
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell:
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open `results/report.html` in a browser. The included report and metrics were generated from the deterministic sample generator. Other generated files are created when you run the pipeline. No account, API key or network connection is needed after dependencies are installed.

## Business question

How can a media business forecast demand, personalize its catalog and allocate a limited programming window?

## What to review

Review daily forecast error against a seasonal baseline, recommendation Recall@5 against popularity, and the exact schedule budget.

`main.py` contains reusable functions and the command-line pipeline. `common.py` creates a portable HTML report and JSON metrics. Generated CSV, SQLite or audio artifacts make the pipeline inspectable.

## Data and limitations

Replace audience.csv generation with dated daily observations; preserve time ordering. Import event_order from real event timestamps. Use users with sufficient history, report cold-start coverage and add ranking diversity. Simulated preferences intentionally create learnable genre structure.

All sample data is generated locally. No real user data, scraped content or pretrained model weights are included. Report results as simulated experiments. Avoid presenting benchmark scores as production performance.

## Deployment plan

Run the command in a scheduled batch job, archive dated outputs, and serve the static report behind your organization's access controls. Validate input schemas, alert on missing/stale inputs and track evaluation metrics by model version before production. This repository demonstrates the core pipeline; it does not include a managed deployment or monitoring service.

## Interview discussion

Explain the business objective, baseline choice, evaluation split, failure cases and next experiment. Use the generated report to show actual results, including where a baseline fails.

## Reproduce the checks

```console
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Results in `results/` are generated from deterministic simulated data. Metrics should be interpreted as demonstration results, not production claims. The code, report and metrics are committed together so reviewers can inspect the evaluation before running the pipeline. Generated CSV, SQLite and WAV files are ignored by Git.
